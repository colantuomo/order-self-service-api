This repository contains a Node.js TypeScript project that implements a self-service order API using the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal architecture. The API allows users to place and manage their own orders through a convenient interface.

## Hexagonal Structure

(WIP)

([Back to Table of contents](#table-of-contents) :arrow_up:)

---

## Folder Structure

The project follows a DDD-inspired folder structure to separate concerns and maintain a clear code organization. Here's an overview of the key directories:

- `src`
  - `domain`: Contains the core business models, services, and repositories.
  - `application`: Implements the application layer, which orchestrates the domain logic and exposes it through use cases.
  - `infrastructure`: Provides infrastructure-related implementations, such as database connectors or external service clients.
  - `web`: Handles API-specific concerns such as route definitions and request validation.
